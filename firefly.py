"""
This model illustrates the spontaneous synronization of large crowds without a
central central clock or synronization tool. In this model, the agents
(fireflies) start chaning color (blinkin) at random frequencies. However, at
each simulation run, the agents increase or decrease the frequencies based on
the average ofneighborung agents' blinkin frequencies. After a certain number
of simulation runs, we see that all of the agents are blinking at the pretty
much same frequency.

This behaviour is shown by calculating the standard deviation in the blinking
frequencies with the environment action.

"""
Thomas Schelling's famous model of neighborhood 
segregation. This model illustrates how individual 
tendencies regarding neighbours can lead to segregation.
Here, each agent belongs to two groups and aims to recide
in a neighbourhood, where the fraction of friend`s is high.
Whether the agent will move, is based on two 
parameters: 'hood_ratio' and 'tolerance'.
